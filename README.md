# ComplexNetworks
Java library for handling complex network dynamics
========================

Graph library developed initially by A.Stanoev and D.Smilkov

We have used this framework to produce the results for the paper 

[Stanoev, Angel, Daniel Trpevski, and Ljupco Kocarev. "Modeling the spread of multiple concurrent contagions on networks." PloS one 9, no. 6 (2014): e95669.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095669)

 and 
 
 [Stanoev, Angel, Daniel Smilkov, and Ljupco Kocarev. "Identifying communities by influence dynamics in social networks." Physical Review E 84.4 (2011): 046102.](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.5247v2.pdf).

-------------------------
Requirements
-------------------------

You need a recent version of Java (1.6).

Using the framework
===================

Simulating contagion spreading processes on networks
---------------------------------------------------
Simulations can be run from cs.contagion.MultiDiseaseSpread
Simulations for MultiPlex spreading can be run from cs.contagion.MultiplexSpread
example code to follow..
